This repository contains a collection of Power BI projects that demonstrate the end‑to‑end workflow of building analytical dashboards. Each project showcases the complete lifecycle from data ingestion and transformation to modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visual design.
</p>

Following techniques and components were used for preparing dashboards:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query**
  - Handling missing values, standardizing formats, merging and appending files.
  - Creating custom logic through conditional columns and applied steps.
- **Data Modeling**
  - Building relationships between fact and dimension tables.
  - Applying star/snowflake schema structures where appropriate.
  - Using calculated tables to support advanced modeling needs.
- **DAX & Measures**
  - Creating core metrics such as revenue, profit, totals, percentages, KPIs, MoM/YoY comparisons.
  - Implementing time‑intelligence functions to support trend analysis.
  - Building dynamic measures for slicer interactions and visual behavior.
- **Dashboard Design**
  - Constructing intuitive layouts with charts, cards, matrices, tooltips, and navigation tabs.
  - Applying themes for color consistency and readability.
  - Adding slicers to enhance interaction and enable deeper exploration.
